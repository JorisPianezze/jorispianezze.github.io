Introduction
*********************************************************

This documentation describes how to set up and run a coupled simulation between `Meso-NH <http://mesonh.aero.obs-mip.fr>`_ and `WW3 <https://polar.ncep.noaa.gov/waves/wavewatch>`_ and/or `CROCO <https://www.croco-ocean.org>`_ with the `OASIS <https://oasis.cerfacs.fr/en/home>`_ coupler. It does'nt contain detailed explanations on the use of Meso-NH, WW3, CROCO or OASIS. You are therefore advised to familiarise yourself with these models before reading this documentation.

The developments were carried out as part of an Ocean-Wave-Atmosphere project group
initiated by the Centre National de Recherches Météorologiques (`CNRM <https://www.umr-cnrm.fr/>`_) around the `SURFEX <https://www.umr-cnrm.fr/surfex/>`_  surface model :cite:p:`voldoire_surfex_2017,pianezze_new_2018`.

The coupling algorithm implemented enables coupled ocean-wave-atmosphere simulations to be carried out for any study case or any regional geographical area. The possible exchanges between the different components of the coupled system are illustrated in the following figure :
