Installation
*********************************************************

You can install models where you want but I suggest that you to put the models in a directory dedicated to the case study,
especially if you intend to test new versions of models, compilers or libraries.

At the end of this section you need to have 3 directories : MNH-V5-7-0, WW3 and croco.

.. _RST install_MNH:

Meso-NH/SurfEx (+ NetCDF and OASIS)
====================================

To download Meso-NH's package you can follow the instructions in the A-INSTALL file or in the Meso-NH developer's guide. Below you will find the minimum steps required to install the last coupling developments.

Get's Meso-NH package for developers via following git clone command :

.. code-block:: bash
  
   git clone gitladev@mesonh2.aero.obs-mip.fr:/gitladevrepos/MNH-ladev.git -b MNH-57-branch MNH-V5-7-0

that will create the MNH-V5-7-0 directory containing a clone (copy) of the Meso-NH package of the
remote branch MNH-57-branch.
   
.. note::

   This version of Meso-NH already contains NetCDF and oasis3-mct_5.0 libraries and you can compile it automatically when you compile Meso-NH (for that go to the section :ref:`RST compile_MNH`).
   
.. warning::

   This development's branch will evolve and is likely to contain bugs. Please send me an email if you encounter any bugs.
