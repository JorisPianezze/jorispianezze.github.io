Verification - ktest
*********************************************************

To check that Meso-NH has been successfully installed and compiled with OASIS, you can run the ktest 013_Iroise_OASIS_coupling. It corresponds to a coupled simulation between Meso-NH and toy model with OASIS. 

To launch this ktest, do : 

.. code-block:: bash

   cd MY_RUN/KTEST/013_Iroise_OASIS_coupling
   ./run_013_Iroise_OASIS_coupling  

.. note::

   Don't forget to load conf/profile_mesonh before launching the ktest.


At the end of the simulation, you need to find at the end of the debug.XX.000000 files in A_cpl_mnh_toy directory : 

.. code-block:: bash

   (oasis_terminate) SUCCESSFUL RUN
   -- EXIT  (oasis_terminate)


And this figure needs to be plotted (MY_RUN/KTEST/013_Iroise_OASIS_coupling/A_cpl_mnh_toy/U10_CHA/U10_CHA.png): 

.. figure:: U10_CHA.png

   The first line corresponds to the 10m u-wind speed sent from Meso-NH (a) to the toy model (b). The second line corresponds to the Charnock coefficient sent by the toy model (c) to Meso-NH (d).
   Differences are due to the interpolation method (:command:`SCRIPR BILINEAR LR SCALAR LATLON 1` for first line, :command:`SCRIPR DISTWGT LR SCALAR LATLON 1 4` for second line).

.. note::
