Welcome to CROCO / ABL1d coupling's documentation
============================================================

The purpose of this tutorial is to present the different steps to set up :

* an idealized simulation with the Atmospheric Boundary Layer 1d (ABL1d) model based on :cite:t:`kilpatrick_boundary_2014` case study (Section :ref:`section_kilpatrick`; see also :cite:t:`spall_midlatitude_2007,kilpatrick_boundary_2014,ayet_analytical_2019,lemarie_simplified_2021`) ;

* a real case ABL1d - CROCO based on BENGUELA_LR ktest (Section :ref:`section_benguela_lr`).
  
Description of the ABL1d model can be found in :cite:t:`lemarie_simplified_2021`. Same version of the ABL1d model described in this paper has been implemented in CROCO.
